	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Realtek devices. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

	  Say Y here if you have a Realtek Ethernet adapter belonging to
	  the following families:
	  RTL8169 Gigabit Ethernet
	  RTL8168 Gigabit Ethernet
	  RTL8101 Fast Ethernet
	  RTL8125 2.5GBit Ethernet

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called r8169.  This is recommended.
